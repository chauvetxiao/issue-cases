# Issue Cases

If you have any problem with any repos under spmjs account. Fork this repo, and put your case in it.

Your case should be named `{{repo}}-{{issue id}}`, like `spm2-1` for instance.

Your case should contain:

1. a readme file, explain how to reproduce the bug
2. simple code, as simple as possible (don't put your whole project in it)
